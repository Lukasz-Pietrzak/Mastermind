This is a game created using Canvas and JavaScript that requires a good memory and strategy to win.
At the beginning the alghorithm which I've created choose 5 random colors, for example (remember these colors) [saddlebrown, blue, red, yellow, red]. Your goal is to guess these colors clicking in the rectangles, but in exactly the same positions that alghorithm has created. Your only tip are generated color faces displaying every time after finish the round. What works these faces? There're color gold, blue and red always displaying in this way in order to hinder the game. If there's no gold face, then display blue and red. If there's no gold and blue, then display only red faces. Let's look at this example - You've choosed these colors [red, red, green, yellow, red] - The tip-faces will be gold, gold, blue, red, red, because we have 2 correct positions (yellow,red), one matching color but on incorrect position(red), and two colors completely unmatching comparing in colors generated by alghoritm(there're only two red colors generated, not three. On the other hand saddlebrown hasn't been created at all). If you miss click, you may undo changes clicking "popraw" rectangle. After guess every color in correct positon, you win the game and you may play again.
